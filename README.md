# java-polynomial-minimizer
Java program that implements a directional search algorithm known as the steepest decent algorithm.

Three .txt polynomial files have been added for testing. Higher order polynomials can also be tested and minimized by the code. If you would like to test other polynomials, please use the same polynomial format that is used in the .txt files.
